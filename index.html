         Welcome to my website! 
         <br>
         <br>
         My name is Yisheng Tu (涂以晟). I was born and raised in Nanchang, JiangXi province, China. I'm interested in Astronomy and music so I pursued double major in Mathematics and 'Physics and Astronomy' during my undergraduate education at the University of Rochester (Rochester, NY, USA), with a minor in music. Following my undergraduate studies, I'm currently a Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Virginia (UVA, Charlottesville, VA, USA).

         <br>
         In my free time, I am deeply engaged in music. I have been playing the piano since I was 6 years old and have performed on the Carillon at the University of Rochester. More recently, I took up the flute during my Ph.D. studies, seeking a more portable instrument (than the piano and the Carillon). I also sang in the University of Rochester choirs throughout my undergraduate years.
         <br>
         <br>
         Beyond music, I have a keen interest in aviation and hold a private pilot certificate (you can learn more on my <a href="flying/flying.html">flying</a> page). Additionally, I am passionate about badminton and currently play with the University of Virginia Badminton Club.
